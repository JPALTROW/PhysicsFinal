# WHAT IT DO
Our program simulates a large chain of spvings with dampening similar to air-resistance. \
Each spving has two ballz on each end, with a certain user-selected mass. \
When the program is run you can watch as gravity acts on the chain of spvingz and they stretch. \
We also graph potential (gravitational and elastic energies), kinetic, and total energy. \

## INTERESTING STUFF IT DOOS
All three energy graphs should follow dampened oscillation curves. \
The greatest decrease in kinetic energy should occur at the times when motion is fastest, because dampening is proportional to velocity squared. \
These periods of great dampening will occur when potential energy is low (since at this point all energy is kinetic). \
In general, the gwaphs are pwetty.

# WHAT DO YOU DO TO GET IT TO DO
Upon running the program you should see a blank screen, and some text and sliders at the bottom. \
This should (from left to right) allow you to:
* Select the ball whose mass you would like to edit (drop down menu)
* Select the mass of the ball chosen above (slider)
* Select the number of balls in the chain (slider)
* Begin the simulation (button)

After clicking begin, you can sit back, relax and enjoy your flight! \
Trails for each mass can be toggled with the trail button.

# PARTING THOUGHTS
Our simulation has all the code necessary to handle z-axis motion, we just never had any in the initial configuration. \
Please don't destroy?!?
